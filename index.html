            <h2 >ABOUT THE BAND</h2>
            <p>Rock band Linkin Park was formed in Agoura Hills, California in 1996 by high school friends Brad Delson, Mike Shinoda and Rob Bourdon. Originally named Xero, the band recruited Joe Hahn, Dave Farrell and Mark Wakefield and used what limited money and resources they had to record a demo.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Linkin Park dropped their debut, Hybrid Theory, in 2000. Featuring music they had worked on over the last five years, the album was a smash hit and was certified gold within five weeks. Thanks to its blend of nu metal and hip hop elements, it became the best-selling record of the year, with help from the Grammy-winning single “Crawling,” the alt rock standard “One Step Closer,” and the extremely popular “In the End.”</p>

                <h2>ODE</h2>
                <p>On the afternoon of May 26th, Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington gave a performance unlike any in his career. His close friend, Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, was being laid to rest at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. “My name is Chester,” Bennington told the mourners gathered there. “I had the great privilege of being a friend of Chris and invited to be a member of his family.” Then, accompanied by Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson on guitar, he sang “Hallelujah.” Bennington had become famous in the early 2000s as the powerhouse voice of one of rock’s biggest bands, expressing himself through an angst-ridden scream, but that day his singing was different: plaintive, somber, fragile. He also paid tribute to Cornell on Twitter: “Your voice was joy and pain, anger and forgiveness, love and heartache all wrapped up into one. I suppose that’s what we all are. You helped me understand that.”</p>
